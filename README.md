# Real Time Chat

## Description
A real time chat application where a user can login in with their google account
and make chat rooms and invite others to talk. They are able to make multiple
chat rooms and invite as many people as they want to each one. A user needs to
have a google account in order to chat. This project is a practice project
following the YouTube video [Build a BETTER Facebook Messenger Chat Application
| React JS, Firebase, Chat Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv9Js3QLOLY)
by [JavaScript
Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A). Here in the
video I tried to code ahead of the video, but since I needed to learn this
concepts behind a chat room I would often follow the video.

## Summary
I plan in the future to build my own chat project and incorporate chat rooms in
other projects, so I believe that this project would be very helpful in the near
future. Foloowing the video and doign some reasearch I was able to learn the
basic concpets of build a chat room and structuring them in a file. It also
introduced me to libraries tha cna help build the chat room and how to manage
the and handle the users and their data.

## Tools
For this project it was built with React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the
visuals. For the chat room the data was handled with axios and api.chatengine.io, and was
managed with react-chat-engine. Lastly everything was put together with
firebase.
